I can honestly say that this app is really helpful and gives alot of free trading signals and indicators. If you want more than a few indicators turned on though you'll have to start paying for it which is 15 a month. Free access still gives you alot and is worth using. If u pay though you'll get to use and apply technical indicators and copy professional analytics. Very clean UI and easy to navigate. Supports dark mode as well. Also very accurate and not lagging at all with the market pulse.,honestly say really helpful gives alot free trading signals indicators want indicators turned though start paying month free access still gives alot worth using pay though get use apply technical indicators copy professional analytics clean ui easy navigate supports dark mode well also accurate lagging market pulse
"I've seen the workaround for it in the responses, but I'm also going to point out the bad UX that is the new popup when you click on a symbol before you get to the full chart from the latest update.

Amazing app BEST for trading wouldnt exchange it for any other now or anytime in the future if it stays like this and keeps making slight updates. 2 things I would like to see if possible and is only pertaining to the drawings and marking one puts on the charts is 1. A function to be able to delete/erase a number of drawings at once as doing it 1 by 1 can be time consuming. And 2. Is when I have more than 1500-2000+ drawings/lines and boxes on a chart it becomes really slow and lags alot .

"I am a beginner and have thoroughly enjoyed using the app. I have, over the last 6 weeks, gradually improved my understanding of the beginner's tools. Also getting familiar with the functionality. I understand that there are links to direct trading but not sure if this is applicable to all stock markets. The reason for my learning technical analysis was that as a log term investor , I have missed several opportunities to exit my holdings over the last 2 decades and learning technical analysis and familiarizing with one platform would serve me well. I endeavour t o subscribe to the platform once I have improved my skills. In the mean time , this is a great platform for learning using multiple tutorials and other youtube videos and online educational materials. Thank you. I can add only one further comment. I am planning to invest in a 32 inch touch screen monitor to improve the analysis as the Note 9 is a very small screen.",beginner thoroughly enjoyed using last weeks gradually improved understanding beginners tools also getting familiar functionality understand links direct trading sure applicable stock markets reason learning technical analysis log term investor missed several opportunities exit holdings last decades learning technical analysis familiarizing one platform would serve well endeavour subscribe platform improved skills mean time great platform learning using multiple tutorials youtube videos online educational materials thank add one comment planning invest inch touch screen monitor improve analysis note small screen

"I don't have auto update on apps so I still have the classic version of TV and its 5 stars, once they have tick charts it will be the number 1 platform on the market.

"Updated for a detailed & encouraging view: For sure they continuously introduce minor but useful feature updates on a monthly basis on the app & desktop (CPU/memory usage could be improved). Quick back testing helps avoid unplanned drawdowns. Webhook alerts pretty reliable, could introduce sections in Alerts for quick sorting. However, response sometimes become slightly delayed and a data feed issue once got resolved only after 5 hours, which was a shocker. As the community keeps growing, a dedicated broken/stuck data reporting & resolution becomes of paramount importance than anything else. This will help them isolate critical issues smoothly. Still, the most futuristic & modern charting solution out there.👍🏻",updated detailed encouraging view sure continuously introduce minor useful feature updates monthly basis desktop cpumemory usage could improved quick back testing helps avoid unplanned drawdowns webhook alerts pretty reliable could introduce sections alerts quick sorting however response sometimes become slightly delayed data feed issue got resolved hours shocker community keeps growing dedicated brokenstuck data reporting resolution becomes paramount importance anything else help isolate critical issues smoothly still futuristic modern charting solution

Very helpful making charts but the new update like other reviewers have said does make you click more times than previous version which is a pain. One thing that I miss that was super helpful was the hide all button. If you would bring that back to the mobile version then I would be okay with the new update. Also if you could make more options for lines that would be amazing. Currently only three and when you add a lot of lines that look similar it gets kind of hard to read.,helpful making charts new update like reviewers said make click times previous version pain one thing miss super helpful hide button would bring back mobile version would okay new update also could make options lines would amazing currently three add lot lines look similar gets kind hard read

This latest update got rid of the option to have the classic chart view vs revised. Not sure why this isn't an option left to the user.

"App worked fine on my Galaxy S10 about 2 months ago, then some random update came along and I no longer receive any notifications to my system tray from app alerts.
